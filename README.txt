dotfiles and ~/bin

---------------

A collection point for my various dotfiles, binaries, and what ever I find on old harddrives and usb keys that I want to keep. Dust bunnies and all.

~/bin

::  aur_installer.py  - For those of us who must look it up every single time... This is a simple program meant to automate the installation of AUR packages.
